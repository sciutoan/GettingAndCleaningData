Code Book.md is a code book that describes the variables and my process to clean the data

run_analysis.R cleans the data as per the 5 steps required in the course project’s definition:

	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

averagedata.txt is the final data file after completing the steps above
