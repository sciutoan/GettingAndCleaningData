The run_analysis.R script does the following as per course instructions: 
  #1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  #2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  #3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  #4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  #5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each    variable for each activity and each subject.


#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

  #Read Labels and Features
    activity_labels: List of activities performed; taken from course dataset
    features:Come from the accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals; taken from course dataset
    
  #Read test data
    subject_test: Contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects; taken from course dataset
    X_test: Contains recorded features test data; taken from course dataset
    y_test: Contains test data of activities’ code labels; taken from course dataset
    
  #Read train data
    subject_train: Contains train data of volunteer subjects; taken from course dataset
    X_train: Contains recorded features train data; taken from course dataset
    y_train: Contains train data of activities’code labels; taken from course dataset

  #Merge data
    xdata: Created by rbind-ing X_train and X_test
    ydata: Created by rbind-ing y_train and y_test
    subjectdata: Created by rbind-ing subject_train and subject_test
    mergeddata: Created by cbind-ing xdata, ydata and subjectdata


#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

  Cleandata: Created by subsetting mergeddata and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation


#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

  Replaces the column names using the correct activity names


#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
  Replaces the column names using the correct activity names


#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  averagedata: displays the mean for each variable for each activity after grouping by subject and activity
